    The OpenShift Commons Gathering/Amsterdam content will be merged into the upcoming Virtual Red Hat Summit Gathering on April 27th and the CNCF/Kubecon/NA in Boston.
    We are looking forward to still delivering all of our sessions and workshops, including the OpenShift 4/Kubernetes Release Updates and Road Map, and all of our engineering project 
    leads will still be delivering their “State of” Deep Dive talks as part of the Virtual Gathering on April 27th. We’re working with our case study speakers and other guest speakers to ensure they can adjust their schedules (and vacation plans) to share their talks as well.
    We will provide updates here soon, you can register now for the virtual event and get notified with further details via email about when you can tune in and how to do so.
    If you’ve purchased a pass to the Amsterdam Gathering and any of the workshops, you will receive a full refund.
