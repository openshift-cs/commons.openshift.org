              "At Twistlock, we’ve helped secure some of the world’s largest and earliest adopters of containers. Our customers span six continents and nearly every industry, but one thing we consistently see is that companies that run mission critical apps in containers are choosing OpenShift as their container platform of choice.
              <br /><br />
              The combination of OpenShift's enterprise grade reliability, OpenShift Commons' active open source community and Red Hat's technical support makes OpenShift an especially good choice for the customers we work with in healthcare, financial services, and government. Not only does Twistlock have great support for OpenShift as a platform, but we are proud to have contributed security and authorizations to the OpenShift open source project."
