## Forking this repository

The first thing you need to do is to [fork this repository](https://github.com/openshift/commons.openshift.org#fork-destination-box) into your own github account.

Then, clone it into your local machine:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:your-username/commons.openshift.org
```

And add the `upstream` remote to follow this repository's changes:

```bash
$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:openshift/commons.openshift.org
$ git fetch upstream
```


## Adding New Members

Currently the most common task is to add members' information to the website, i.e., 
their logo, name, and url. You can check if any there's any logo waiting to be added 
on this repository's [issues](https://github.com/openshift-cs/commons.openshift.org/issues).

There exists a shell script and Java program within the repository that automates the addition 
of partners to OpenShift Commons. To use the script and program to add a partner, add an Issue 
where the body is in the following format:

```
Company: Company Name
URL: URL of Company's Website
Logo: URL of the Company's Logo (.jpg, .png, .svg, etc)
```

Capitalization of the fields does not matter, however each need to be on different lines, 
spelled correctly, and be followed with `:`. A "TBD" can act as a placeholder for any of 
the three fields. The program will simply skip the issue entirely until the TBD is revised. 


## Adding Gathering Pages and Videos

Gathering pages summarizing information about a particular event can be generated automatically, based on information provided in the `/data/gatherings.yml` file. Details of the gathering event, sponsors and speakers are separated into three groups, explained below with in-line (comments in brackets). If not stated otherwise, the attribute is required and cannot be omitted for the page generation. However, if there are too many details omitted, the page may look plain; make sure to always check that the page is built to your liking, with the data provided in `gatherings.yml`.

**Gatherings**  
Most data about individual event pages is stored here:

```
gatherings:
  - name: "Seattle 2018" (unique; used to build the html page name and the menu link)
    menu: "show" (is not in the site menu, if "show" is not here or the build date of this site is in future
                 compared with the event date below; if this item is absent, a landing page is not built -
                 this allows creating simple name/date/youtube_playlist_id records for past events with
                 exising YouTube playlists)
    language: "English" (optional)
    date: "2018-12-10" (once this is detected to be in past, compared with user's local time, obsolete page sections

    schedule: (required; to be chronologically ordered - the template does not re-order)

        speakers: (optional; if present at least one speaker id is expected)
          - id: "diane" (a unique id defined in speakers list below)
```

As mentioned in the  comment above, this section is also used to reference **YouTube playlists** from past Gatherings. See the `youtube_playlist_id` key description above. The videos are taken from the playlists with relevant details such as video order in the list, video thumbnail, video name and video description; if you need to edit any of these, it should be done in the YouTube playlist itself. When there are any changes made on youTube to a playlist that is already published, the changes will be in effect after the Commons site is re-deployed, as the videos are fetched on build time. Please contact repository maintainers, if you don't feel like waiting for the next site re-build and would like to have the changes deployed as soon as possible.

If a whole landing page does not need to be built for an older gathering, a simple record, such as the following one, would result in publishing videos only from the given YouTube playlist on [the Gatherings Videos page](https://commons.openshift.org/videos.html):

```
gatherings:
  - name: "Austin 2017"
    date: "2017-12-05"
    youtube_playlist_id: "PLaR6Rq6Z4Iqe9xnafdhWdSgD-3qsWTm6K"
```

**Speakers**  
Speaker details that are referenced by `id` in the schedule are kept in this form:

```      
speakers:
  - id: "speaker id" (unique)
    name: "John Doe"
    role: "Everyday Ninja"
    company: "Doe Industries" (optional)
    URL: "https://johndoe.org/about-me/" (optional)
    intro: "John is" (optional; displays a pop up on hover with this text)
    photo: "speakers/diane.jpg" (optional)
```

**Sponsors**  
Sponsors are primarily searched by name in the `/data/participants.yml` list. If the sponsoring company is not yet a Commons participant, they can be defined here, using the same format.

```
sponsors:
  - name: "sponsor" (unique)
    link: "sponsorl_link"
    logo: "sponsor-logos/spensor.png"
```
